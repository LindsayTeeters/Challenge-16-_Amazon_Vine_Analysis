## Overview of Analysis

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufactures dn publishers to receieve reviews for their products. Sellby requested our help on analyzing Amazon reviews written by the members of the Amazon Vine program. These reviewers are paid to review products and publish their reviews to Amazon. These reviews are then displayed in the review section of each of the products on Amazon. Sellby asked us to pick one of the categories to analysize. Tools we utilized within this challenge was: googlecolab, AWS RDS, PySpark, and SQL. We used these to extract, transform, and analyize our dataset to provide a summary to Sellby Stakeholders.
